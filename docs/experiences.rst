         <h3>Data Engineer & Researcher (Baekeland Candidate)</h3>
         <p class="summary-line"><strong>TechWolf</strong>, Ghent, Belgium | Sep 2023 – Nov 2024</p>
      </summary>
      <div class="details-content">

*   **AI Model Development:** Developed and fine-tuned multi-lingual Transformer models (MLST) for skill extraction from diverse HR documents (CVs, job descriptions).
*   **Scalable Data Pipelines:** Built and maintained ETL pipelines using PySpark, GCP Dataflow, and BigQuery for efficient processing and loading of large-scale skill data (>1.5B vacancies analyzed).
*   **Baekeland Research:** Spearheaded research on dynamic career representation learning. Investigated sequential models (Transformers, LLMs) and time-aware techniques to capture career progression beyond static skill sets.
*   **Benchmarking & Ethics:** Contributed to defining novel HR-specific benchmarks (Skill Proficiency, Workforce Planning) and collaborated on responsible AI risk assessments aligned with the EU AI Act.
*   **Tech:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers, LLMs, PySpark, GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow, Vertex AI), Docker, Kubernetes.

         <h3>Research Intern (MSc Thesis)</h3>
         <p class="summary-line"><strong>Imec</strong>, Leuven, Belgium | Jul 2023 – Sep 2024</p>
      </summary>
      <div class="details-content">

*   **Project:** "Expert-Guided Interactive Machine Learning for Integrated Circuit Documentation".
*   **Automated Documentation:** Created an IML system to automate component detection (modules, devices, labels) and measurement linking (DOE files) in complex semiconductor layouts (GDSII/OASIS).
*   **Object Detection:** Applied YOLOv7, optimized with SAHI-inspired slicing for high-resolution images, achieving precise detection of small features. Used OpenCV for device mapping.
*   **IML Application:** Developed a user-friendly desktop application (PyQt) enabling engineers to visually verify, correct, and annotate AI detections (human-in-the-loop).
*   **Feedback & Retraining:** Implemented a robust feedback loop where user corrections were captured and used to automatically retrain the YOLO model, demonstrably improving mAP from 0.77 to 0.85.
*   **Impact:** Reduced layout documentation time significantly (estimated <1 hour vs. weeks) while improving data accuracy and enabling continuous learning.
*   **Tech:** Python, PyQt, PyTorch, YOLOv7, OpenCV, KLayout, SAHI, OCR (DBNet), NMS/NMM.

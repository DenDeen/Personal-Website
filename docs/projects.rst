         <h3>Expert-Guided IML for IC Documentation (MSc Thesis @ Imec)</h3>
         <p class="summary-line">Automating Semiconductor Layout Analysis</p>
      </summary>
      <div class="details-content">

*   **Problem:** Manual documentation of IC layouts is slow and error-prone, hindering rapid prototyping.
*   **Solution:** Developed a desktop application (PyQt) integrating YOLOv7 object detection (via PyTorch/ONNX) with a human-in-the-loop verification interface. Used OpenCV and KLayout for layout processing and SAHI techniques for handling large images. DBNet was used for OCR on layout labels.
*   **Key Feature:** User corrections directly feed back into a retraining pipeline, improving the model's accuracy over time (demonstrated +8% mAP increase).
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, PyQt, PyTorch, YOLOv7, OpenCV, KLayout, SAHI, OCR.

         <h3>Dynamic Career Trajectory Modeling (Research @ TechWolf)</h3>
         <p class="summary-line">Next-Gen AI for HR Skill Intelligence</p>
      </summary>
      <div class="details-content">

*   **Problem:** Static skill profiles fail to capture the dynamic nature of career growth.
*   **Approach:** Contributed to VLAIO Baekeland research exploring sequential (Transformers, LLMs) and time-aware AI models. Designed data strategies for large temporal datasets (combining market vacancy data via PySpark/Dataflow and internal enterprise data).
*   **Goal:** Enable advanced HR features like personalized career pathing, skill proficiency estimation, and strategic workforce planning with explainable AI.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers, LLMs, PySpark, GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow).

         <h3>LSat Datathon - AI Artwork Generation</h3>
         <p class="summary-line">Creative AI with Diffusion Models</p>
      </summary>
      <div class="details-content">

*   **Challenge:** Train a text-to-image diffusion model on a specific art dataset and create a generation pipeline.
*   **Implementation:** Used PyTorch to train a custom diffusion model on Kaggle GPUs. Developed a Streamlit application for generating artwork based on textual prompts.
*   **Achievement:** Secured the "Best Pitch" award for the project presentation and demonstration.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Diffusion Models, Streamlit, Kaggle.

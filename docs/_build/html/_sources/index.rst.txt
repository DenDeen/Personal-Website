      <h1>Hi, I'm Mikkel Skovdal</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">AI Engineer | Data Scientist | Tinkerer</p>

      <p>
         I’m a recent MSc graduate in Computer Science from KU Leuven with a passion for turning complex ideas into real, working systems. Whether it's building AI models, designing data pipelines, or experimenting with proof-of-concepts, I enjoy bringing structure and creativity together to solve tangible problems.
      </p>

      <p>
         I’ve worked in startups, a research lab, and industry settings. Each one improving how I approach technology and collaboration. Most recently, I’ve been diving into AI applications for HR tech and process automation, but I’m always looking for new domains where intelligent systems can make an impact.
      </p>

      <p>
         On the side, I enjoy roundnet (spikeball), climbing, and Magic the Gathering with my friends.
      </p>

      <p>
         I’m driven by curiosity, a desire to build useful things, and a love for clean code. I’m always up for learning new things and tackling challenges from unexpected angles.

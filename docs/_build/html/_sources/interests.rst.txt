Personal Interests
------------------
Beyond algorithms and data structures, I enjoy activities that engage different parts of my brain:

*   **Strategic Board Games:** I love the challenge of games like [mention a specific complex game or two]. They require long-term planning and adapting to changing conditions â€“ much like designing a complex system!
*   **[Your Hobby 1]**: [Description linking it slightly]
*   **[Your Hobby 2]**: [Description linking it slightly]

Semiconductor Musings
---------------------
My technical interests strongly lean towards semiconductors. While I'm an enthusiast learning the ropes rather than an industry veteran, the field constantly amazes me:

*   The scale is mind-boggling: billions of transistors, features measured in nanometers!
*   The physics involved in techniques like EUV lithography or FinFET transistors is fascinating.
*   Witnessing how AI can potentially streamline the extremely complex design-to-fabrication pipeline is what drives my career focus. I find exploring research papers on topics like AI for `EDA (Electronic Design Automation)`_ or ML-based `metrology`_ particularly interesting.

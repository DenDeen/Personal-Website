      <div class="details-content">

*   **Challenge:** Create a PoC with a dataset containing images of artworks and desccriptions.
*   **Solution:** Developed a custom diffusion `model <https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7039243586722222080/>`_ to generate artwork based on textual prompts. The model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 images and descriptions, allowing it to create unique pieces of art.
*   **Implementation:** Used PyTorch to train a custom diffusion model on Kaggle GPUs. Developed a Streamlit application for generating artwork based on textual prompts.
*   **Achievement:** Secured the "Best Pitch" award for the project presentation and demonstration.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Diffusion Models, Streamlit, Kaggle.

         <h3>Project Week - Emotion detection system</h3>
         <p class="summary-line">Project Week in Chandigarh, India | Feb 2019</p>
      </summary>
      <div class="details-content">

*   **Challenge:** Collaboration with European and Indian students to create a project.
*   **Solution:** Developed a system to detect emotions in real-time using a webcam. The system used three different models, one for detecting faces in images, one for detecting predetermined facial features, and one to classify the facial features into classifications such as happy, angry, and others.
*   **Implementation:** Used Python and OpenCV to develop the system. The system was trained on small public datasets and was able to detect emotions in real-time.
